##Optimization using a simple genetic algorithm

The idea is that of simple evolution of a species over generations. This is an attempt to make a GUI for visualizing how evolution can be applied to an optimization problem.

The species consists of creatures that have a common goal and develop the competence to reach the goal after *evolving*.

The algorithm also incorporates the idea of mutations to maintain the genetic diversity of the species to some extent. 

#Instructions for compiling
Simply compile the java file *Life.java* and run.
