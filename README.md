##Optimization with biological evolution

The idea is that of simple evolution of a species over generations. This is an attempt to make a GUI for visualizing how evolution can be applied to an optimization problem.

The species consists of creatures that have a common goal and develop the competence to reach that goal after **evolving**.

The algorithm also incorporates the idea of mutations to maintain the genetic diversity of the species to some extent. 

##Instructions 
Simply compile the java file **Life.java** and run.
